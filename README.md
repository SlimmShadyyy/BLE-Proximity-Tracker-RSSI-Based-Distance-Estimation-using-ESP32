BLE Proximity Tracker: RSSI-Based Distance Estimation using ESP32

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Proximity Tracker using an ESP32 to estimate distances of nearby BLE devices based on RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator). The system uses a Kalman filter to smooth the RSSI values and provides an estimated distance using a log-distance path loss model. This can be used in indoor positioning, asset tracking, or contact tracing applications.

🔧 Features

📡 BLE Scanning: Continuously scans for nearby BLE devices.

🔢 Kalman Filtering: Smooths RSSI fluctuations for better accuracy.

📏 Distance Estimation: Uses RSSI to estimate distance.

📜 Real-Time Data Logging: Displays MAC addresses, RSSI values, and estimated distances.

🔋 ESP32-Based: Low-cost, efficient, and scalable.
